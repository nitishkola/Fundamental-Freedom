            <h3>The Union and its Territory (Articles 1–4)</h3>
            <p>Part I defines the political and territorial boundaries of the Indian Union. It establishes India as a "Union of States" and lays down provisions regarding the formation of new states, alteration of boundaries, and renaming of existing states. This part emphasizes the indestructible nature of the Indian Union while allowing flexibility in reorganizing states based on political and administrative needs.</p>

                <li><strong>Article 1:</strong> Declares India as a Union of States and specifies its territories.</li>
                <li><strong>Article 2:</strong> Empowers Parliament to admit new states into the Union or establish new territories.</li>
                <li><strong>Article 3:</strong> Allows Parliament to alter the boundaries or names of states.</li>
                <li><strong>Article 4:</strong> Provides for laws made under Articles 2 and 3 to include necessary changes in the First and Fourth Schedules and matters incidental to the reorganization of states.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fundamental Rights (Articles 12–35)</h3>

They include the Right to Equality, Right to Freedom, Right Against Exploitation, Right to Freedom of Religion, Cultural and Educational Rights, and the Right to Constitutional Remedies.</p>

                <li><strong>Articles 12-13:</strong> Definition and scope of Fundamental Rights.</li>
