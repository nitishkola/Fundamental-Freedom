            <h2>Citizenship (Articles 5–11)</h2>
            <p>Part II deals with the provisions regarding citizenship in India. It defines who are deemed to be citizens at the commencement of the Constitution (26th January 1950), as well as those who acquired citizenship subsequently. It also addresses various aspects of citizenship like rights, privileges, and restrictions on holding dual nationality.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Article 5:</strong> Defines citizenship at the commencement of the Constitution.</li>
                <li><strong>Article 6:</strong> Citizenship rights of people migrating from Pakistan to India.</li>
                <li><strong>Article 7:</strong> Citizenship rights of individuals returning to India from Pakistan.</li>
                <li><strong>Article 8:</strong> Citizenship rights of Indians residing abroad.</li>
                <li><strong>Article 9:</strong> Prohibition of dual citizenship.</li>
                <li><strong>Article 10:</strong> Continuance of citizenship, subject to laws made by Parliament.</li>
                <li><strong>Article 11:</strong> Empowers Parliament to regulate the right of citizenship through legislation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directive Principles of State Policy (Articles 36–51)</h2>
            <p>Part IV contains the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), which act as guidelines for the government in framing policies and laws. Though not enforceable by any court, these principles aim to establish a just society in India. They focus on promoting social and economic welfare, ensuring equitable distribution of wealth, and maintaining the state's responsibility toward securing justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity among its citizens.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Article 36:</strong> Definition of DPSP.</li>
                <li><strong>Articles 37-51:</strong> Include principles such as promoting the welfare of people, securing a living wage, equal pay for equal work, protection of children and youth, right to education, and the duty of the state to raise the level of nutrition and standard of living.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Fundamental Duties (Article 51A)</h2>
            <p>Fundamental Duties were added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 (during the Emergency period). This part specifies the duties of every citizen of India towards the nation, society, and fellow citizens. Though not legally enforceable, these duties serve as moral obligations and promote a sense of discipline and commitment among citizens.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Article 51A:</strong> Lists the Fundamental Duties, such as respecting the Constitution, cherishing and following the noble ideals of the freedom struggle, upholding and protecting the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India, promoting harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood, protecting the environment, and striving towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity.</li>
